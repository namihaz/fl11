Flask-routing:


* Created a folder named "fl11" to hold a new Flask app.


* In fl11, created a folder named: "static".


* Copied a favicon.ico file into fl11/static/


* In static, created a file named: "blog.html".


* In fl11, created a python script named: "fl11.py

* After running the python script, I used a browser to study blog.html at the URL listed below:
http://localhost:5000

* I followed the above steps and I saw that the Flask app is created.
